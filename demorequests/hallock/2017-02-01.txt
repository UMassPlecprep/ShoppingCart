Stapler (please check for adequate staples)
Table by the door to collect homework (always have this table there)
Table outside to return homework (always have this table there from this

Meter stick (always a meter stick)
No need for a computer until I mention it in the future.

Little box on table with weights
Something to put under the little box to enhance the friction with the
lecture table
Hooks and cord (with end loops) so I can drag the little box with it
Spring balances (2)
The big rope (red and white)
Tennis ball at the end of string
Another tennis ball and a golf ball
1 kg mass

The huge wrench and the big bolt clamped to a movable table -
