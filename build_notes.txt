**Initial recording**
Date: 2/22/2017
Version: 1.0.0
Notes: 
- Professors can request demos
- Chris can update server via /updateProfList
- Testing env and production env are now 2 entities
---> Each has their own nginx instance controlling them and 'server' function (server = production, server1 = testing)
Issues: 
- [FIXED] Responsive Theme on WP site updated, removed calendar JS and CSS files (copied new files over to wp-content folder)
- Buid script updated; server runs correctly after running build.sh
